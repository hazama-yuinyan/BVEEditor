Thank you for downloading!
BVEEditor is an open-source text editor that is intended to edit "BVE" files.
"BVE" is a free-of-charge, high-quality train driving simulator developed by a Japanese.
Although I said that BVEEditor is intended to edit "BVE" files, it can actually be used as a normal text editor,
or even for coding if you create certain addins. I'm not planning to create those addins by myself, at least for now.
